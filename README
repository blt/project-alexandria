Project Alexandria aims to make books in the public domain accessible, beautiful and easy to manage.

Accessible:
- file formats for many devices and screen sizes
- easy to find and download

Beautiful:
- page layout and typography that supports the reading experience
- beautiful to look at

Easy to manage:
- one master file format from which all other formats are derived
- easy collaboration and errata contribution via a distributed version control system

We very much like the work of Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/).
Project Alexandria does not compete with PG in regard to providing and preserving as many books as possible.

We intend to create fewer eBooks that are joyful to read.
